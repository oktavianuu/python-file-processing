This repository contains my solutions and projects for the **PCPP1: File Processing** course from the **Python Institute**. 

I'm focusing on practical skills for data management and application configuration by implementing the following core Python modules:

- **`sqlite3`**: Database interactions (SQLite).
- **`xml`**: Creating and processing XML files.
- **`csv`**: Reading and writing CSV data.
- **`logging`**: Implementing application logging.
- **`configparser`**: Handling configuration files.
